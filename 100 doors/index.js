    // BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION
    // =====================
    
      //create array of 100 closed doors
    
      //create a loop that will start at each of the numbers from 1 to 100: each time you will be positioned at that number and if less than 100 incremented by an amount equivalent to that number (for example start at 2, and increment by 2 -> 4, 6, 8, .., 100) and through each increment change the state of the current corresponding door
    
      //after the you exit the loop return the array of the states of doors!
